      <a href="mailto:?subject=Make Tulsa Safe&amp;body=Dear Tulsa City Council,%0D%0A%0D%0AI am writing to encourage you to support and vote to pass the Welcoming Community Resolution for the City of Tulsa, Oklahoma. %0D%0A%0D%0AA few months ago, Tulsa became the center of national attention when a local business was fire bombed in a hate fueled crime against our LGBTQ+ community and its allyâ€™s. Even though these acts were forceful condemned by Mayor Bynum and several councilors, the violence and ongoing hateful rhetoric we see targeting queer, gay and trans Tulsans leave our city feeling less safe, less welcoming and less inclusive for many of our LGBTQ+ residents. %0D%0A%0D%0AThis resolution is essential to reaffirm the city's commitment to fostering a safe, inclusive, and welcoming community for all Tulsans, visitors, and businesses regardless of sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression. The resolution aims to eliminate disparities and barriers that hinder equitable opportunities and outcomes for all Tulsans.%0D%0A%0D%0APassing this resolution makes clear that the City of Tulsa is a safe and accepting place all Tulsans, visitors, and businesses, regardless of their identity or whom they love. It would disavow the recent hate we have seen in our city and uphold our commitment to embody the Oklahoma standard each and every day.%0D%0A%0D%0AI urge you to pass the Welcoming Community Resolution and demonstrate the City of Tulsa's commitment to continue moving toward a future for our world-class city where everyone is seen and valued for exactly who they are.%0D%0A%0D%0A%0D%0ASincerely, [Your Name]">
